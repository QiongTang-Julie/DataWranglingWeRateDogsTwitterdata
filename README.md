# DataWranglingWeRateDogsTwitterdata
The dataset that we wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators are almost always greater than 10. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
In this project, all the work is done with Jupiter Notebook.
